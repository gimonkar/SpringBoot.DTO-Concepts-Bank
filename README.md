📘 Overview

This project is a Simple Bank System built using Spring Boot, where I practiced and implemented key backend development concepts such as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), Object-Oriented relationships, and Spring Data JPA mappings.

The main goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of how data flows between different layers of a Spring Boot application while keeping the code clean, modular, and scalable.

🚀 Features

🧩 DTO Implementation:
Used DTOs to transfer data between layers efficiently and securely.

🔗 Object-Oriented Relationships:
Implemented Has-A (association) relationships between entities to model real-world banking system components.

💾 Database Relationships:
Practiced One-to-One mapping using Spring Data JPA to establish relationships between entities.

📋 Collections Framework:
Used ArrayList from Java Collections for handling entity lists and data management.

🧠 Learning Focus:
Improved understanding of Spring Boot architecture
Practiced Entity relationships and DTO conversions
Enhanced data abstraction and encapsulation concepts
